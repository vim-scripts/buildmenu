Grab the latest dev version from github: https://github.com/shirai07/buildmenu.

If you use the build-tool Waf (http://code.google.com/p/waf), this plugin will
assist you by providing a comfortable sidebar menu which lists major Waf
commands and all existing build-targets of your current project. You can
select one or more targets from the list for building.

See https://github.com/shirai07/buildmenu/wiki for a screenshot.


Mappings in the sidebar menu:

<Space>
select or unselect a build-target from the list. the target
is highlighted in a different color to visualize your choice

<Return>
start building your selected build-target(s) with Waf. The
resulting build command would usually look like this:
   ./waf --targets=common,unittest1,unitest2

'R'
refresh build target list (plugin will run cmd "waf list" again)

You need to set a key-mapping in your .vimrc file to open/close the sidebar
menu (install this plugin and see its help file for details).


This script is still quite young and far from being feature complete.
Planned features for future versions:

 * user can add own args to the waf command-line for building
 * quick-help in the style of NERDTree (when pressing ?)
 * support of other build systems like SCons and GNU Make (if feasible)
 * multiselect targets via visual mode
 * 'U' unselect all
